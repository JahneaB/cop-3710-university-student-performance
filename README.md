# University Student Performance & Lifestyle Analysis

## Project Description
This database application is designed to track and analyze the relationship between student academic performance and their social/behavioral habits (such as alcohol consumption and health status). The system manages core enrollment data across different schools while monitoring period grades (G1, G2, G3) to identify how lifestyle factors impact overall GPA.

## Key Features:
* **Academic Tracking:** Manages Students, Courses, and Schools.
* **Performance Analysis:** Stores period grades to compute automated GPA reports.
* **Behavioral Logging:** Tracks workday and weekend alcohol consumption, health status, and social activity to provide a holistic view of student success.
* **Prerequisite Management:** Includes logic to ensure students meet course requirements before enrollment.

## User Groups
* **Registrar:** Responsible for maintaining the integrity of student records, course offerings, and official enrollment data.
* **Academic Advisors:** Use the system to monitor student performance and lifestyle logs to provide proactive counseling and support.
* **Students:** Can view their own enrollment history, grades, and computed GPA.
#PART A
Project Scope:
University Student Performance & Enrollment System
• This project involves designing and implementing a robust relational database to manage the complete academic lifecycle of university students while integrating social and behavioral factors that influence performance.

Application Domain
•	The system will serve as an Academic Management System for a secondary or higher education institution, focusing on the correlation between student lifestyle (such as alcohol consumption and social life) and academic success.

Target Users
•	University Registrars: To manage enrollments, enforce course prerequisites, and issue official transcripts.
•	Academic Advisors: To monitor student performance and identify at-risk students based on social and behavioral data.
•	Students: To view their current grades, attendance records, and computed GPAs

Data Sources
•	Demographic Data: Age, sex, address, and family size.
•	Academic Data: School type, study time, failures, and grades across multiple periods.
