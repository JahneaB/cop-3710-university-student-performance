# University Student Performance & Lifestyle Analysis

## Project Description
This database application is designed to track and analyze the relationship between student academic performance and their social/behavioral habits (such as alcohol consumption and health status). The system manages core enrollment data across different schools while monitoring period grades (G1, G2, G3) to identify how lifestyle factors impact overall GPA.

## Key Features:
* **Academic Tracking:** Manages Students, Courses, and Schools.
* **Performance Analysis:** Stores period grades to compute automated GPA reports.
* **Behavioral Logging:** Tracks workday and weekend alcohol consumption, health status, and social activity to provide a holistic view of student success.
* **Prerequisite Management:** Includes logic to ensure students meet course requirements before enrollment.

## User Groups
* **Registrar:** Responsible for maintaining the integrity of student records, course offerings, and official enrollment data.
* **Academic Advisors:** Use the system to monitor student performance and lifestyle logs to provide proactive counseling and support.
* **Students:** Can view their own enrollment history, grades, and computed GPA.
